every 60 gens.  Two stationary guns produce a glider every 60
gens and an eastward MWSS every 120 gens; half of the gliders
delete the MWSSs while the other half escape.  But when a
westward MWSS reaches the guns, it deletes 2 consecutive gliders,
allowing one eastward MWSS to escape and suppressing one output
glider.  When an eastward MWSS hits a boat, it becomes a NEward
glider which deletes one westward MWSS.  Thus, each westward
MWSS that reaches the guns causes the deletion of a later
westward MWSS.  Specifically, if the westward MWSSs are
numbered starting at 3, then, for each integer  K >= 2,  MWSS
number  floor(K phi)  causes the deletion of MWSS number
floor(K (phi+1)),  where  phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2.  Also, a glider
escapes from the bottom of the pattern about generation
120 floor(K (phi+1)).  Relative to a complete p120 glider stream,
the resulting stream of gliders has density  1/(phi+1) =

the population is  15n + 4524.
This uses two salvos which are sent toward blocks along the
southeast diagonal.  Usually there are 2 blocks on the diagonal.
At such times, a 3-glider salvo pulls the nearest block 5 units
and sends back a glider.  This is done repeatedly, waiting for the
return glider from each pull before sending the next one.  When the
nearest block is pulled as far back as possible, it is deleted, and
a 5-glider salvo is sent toward the other block; the salvo
duplicates the block, creating a new one 10 units farther away and
another one 10 units closer.
Deleting the eater on the western edge of the pattern gives
population asymptotic to  C2 t^(2/3),  where  C2 = (45/256)^(1/3).
In particular, in gen  720 n^3 + 28620 n^2 + 60 n + 3840

More specifically, for  n>=4,  the population in gen  20 3^n + 90
is  (5n^2 + 43) 3^(n-1) - (15n^4 + 70n^3 + 237n^2 + 254n)/12 + 3440.

In gen  20 3^n - 123  (n>=2),  a glider in an exponential aperiodic
device bounces off a fixed reflector.  The bounce turns on a MWSS
gun and sends a glider toward a diagonal line of boats, as in the
linear aperiodic pattern.  The MWSSs destifle guns produced by a
stifled breeder.  When a glider returns from the nearest boat, the
MWSS gun is turned off, having produced  n+1  MWSSs.  In gen t,
about  log(t)/log(3)  MWSS pulses have occurred, activating about
log(t)^2 / (2 log(3)^2)  guns, which have produced about
t log(t)^2 / (60 log(3)^2)  gliders.`,wikiLink:"https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Infinite_growth",patternLink:"https://www.conwaylife.com/patterns/tlogtsquared.rle",size:[369,240],rule:"b3/s23"},"p51honeyfarmhassler.rle":{fileName:"p51honeyfarmhassler.rle",name:"p51honeyfarmhassler.rle",derivedName:"Honey farm hasslers",author:"",comment:"",wikiLink:"https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Honey_farm_hasslers",patternLink:"https://www.conwaylife.com/patterns/p51honeyfarmhassler.rle",size:[26,36],rule:"b3/s23"},"p83glidergun.rle":{fileName:"p83glidergun.rle",name:"p83glidergun.rle",derivedName:"62P83",author:"",comment:"",wikiLink:"https://conwaylife.com/wiki/62P83",patternLink:"https://www.conwaylife.com/patterns/p83glidergun.rle",size:[66,30],rule:"b3/s23"},"p42rpentominohasslers.rle":{fileName:"p42rpentominohasslers.rle",name:"p42rpentominohasslers.rle",derivedName:"R-pentomino hasslers",author:"",comment:"",wikiLink:"https://conwaylife.com/wiki/R-pentomino_hasslers",patternLink:"https://www.conwaylife.com/patterns/p42rpentominohasslers.rle",size:[109,43],rule:"b3/s23"},"230p8.rle":{fileName:"230p8.rle",name:"230p8.rle",derivedName:"230P8",author:"Arie Paap, 2019",comment:"",wikiLink:"https://conwaylife.com/wiki/230P8",patternLink:"https://conwaylife.com/patterns/230p8.rle",size:[49,20],rule:"b3/s23"},"84p87.rle":{fileName:"84p87.rle",name:"84P87",derivedName:"84P87",author:"",comment:"The smallest known period-87 oscillator.",wikiLink:"https://conwaylife.com/wiki/84P87",patternLink:"",size:[37,41],rule:"b3/s23"},"cisverylonghookwithtail.rle":{fileName:"cisverylonghookwithtail.rle",name:"cisverylonghookwithtail.rle",derivedName:"Cis-very long hook with tail",author:"",comment:"",wikiLink:"https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Cis-very_long_hook_with_tail",patternLink:"https://www.conwaylife.com/patterns/cisverylonghookwithtail.rle",size:[6,5],rule:"b3/s23"},"p42rpentominohassler2.rle":{fileName:"p42rpentominohassler2.rle",name:"p42rpentominohassler2.rle",derivedName:"Period-42 R-pentomino hasslers",author:"",comment:"",wikiLink:"https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Period-42_R-pentomino_hasslers",patternLink:"https://www.conwaylife.com/patterns/p42rpentominohassler2.rle",size:[47,29],rule:"b3/s23"},"period156glidergun_synth.rle":{fileName:"period156glidergun_synth.rle",name:"period156glidergun_synth.rle",derivedName:"Period-156 glider gun",author:"Mark Niemiec, 28 May 2013",comment:`16-glider synthesis of period-156 glider gun

88-glider synthesis of c/4 orthogonal spaceship 46P4H1V0.
Discovered by Tanner Jacobi and Martin Grant on 4 February 2019,
and subsequently optimized by several contributors.
This is the first glider synthesis of a c/4 orthogonal spaceship.
Repeat time for this synthesis variant ia 572 ticks, as shown.
