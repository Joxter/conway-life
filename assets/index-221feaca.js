the population is  15n + 4524.
This uses two salvos which are sent toward blocks along the
southeast diagonal.  Usually there are 2 blocks on the diagonal.
At such times, a 3-glider salvo pulls the nearest block 5 units
and sends back a glider.  This is done repeatedly, waiting for the
return glider from each pull before sending the next one.  When the
nearest block is pulled as far back as possible, it is deleted, and
a 5-glider salvo is sent toward the other block; the salvo
duplicates the block, creating a new one 10 units farther away and
another one 10 units closer.
Deleting the eater on the western edge of the pattern gives
population asymptotic to  C2 t^(2/3),  where  C2 = (45/256)^(1/3).
